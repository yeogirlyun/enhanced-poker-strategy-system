"""
Comprehensive Test Suite for Improved Poker State Machine (Upgraded)

Tests all critical fixes and additional edge cases:
1. BB folding bug fix (BB checks with weak hands when no raise)
2. Dynamic position tracking
3. Correct raise logic
4. All-in state tracking and side pots
5. Strategy integration (preflop and postflop)
6. Input validation
7. State transitions
8. Showdown and winner determination
9. Hand evaluation cache
10. Multi-player interactions
11. Sound integration
12. Hand history logging
13. SESSION TRACKING - NEW!
    - Session initialization and lifecycle
    - Hand result capture
    - Session statistics and analysis
    - Session export/import
    - Hand replay capabilities
    - Debug information capture
    - Session metadata tracking
