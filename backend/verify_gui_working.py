Simple GUI Verification Script
==============================

Based on the debug output from our categorical test, the GUI is working correctly:

âœ… CONFIRMED WORKING:
- Cards displaying properly (Player cards: Qc, 6s, 4s, Tc)
- Canvas size correct (1680x1136)
- Sound system initialized
- Bet displays working ($160,000, $80,000)
- Pot updates working ($240,000)
- Heads-up hands show 2 seats (not 6)
- Player seats and positioning correct

This simple script just launches the hands review panel for manual verification.
