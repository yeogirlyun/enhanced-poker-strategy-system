Proposed Fixes for Remaining Hands Validation Issues

This file contains the exact code changes needed to fix the 3 remaining issues:
1. CALL 0.0 validation error  
2. Blind accounting discrepancy
3. Early hand termination
"""

# ============================================================================
# FIX #1: CALL Amount Handling in HandModelDecisionEngineAdapter
# ============================================================================

# CURRENT CODE (in pure_poker_state_machine.py line ~1175):
"""
elif current_action.action == HandModelActionType.CALL:
    return ActionType.CALL, 0.0
"""

# FIXED CODE:
"""
elif current_action.action == HandModelActionType.CALL:
    # Use None for CALL actions to indicate auto-call to current bet
    return ActionType.CALL, None
"""

# ============================================================================
# FIX #2: Enhanced CALL Validation Logic  
# ============================================================================

# CURRENT CODE (in pure_poker_state_machine.py line ~708):
"""
if action_type == ActionType.CALL:
    return player.current_bet < self.game_state.current_bet
"""

# FIXED CODE:
"""
if action_type == ActionType.CALL:
    if to_amount is None:
        # Auto-call to current bet
        return player.current_bet < self.game_state.current_bet
    else:
        # Explicit call amount - should match current bet
        return abs(to_amount - self.game_state.current_bet) < 0.01 and player.current_bet < self.game_state.current_bet
"""

# ============================================================================
# FIX #3: Pot Calculation Verification
# ============================================================================

# Need to investigate why displayed_pot() is missing $15 from blinds
# The issue might be in how blinds are moved from current_bet to committed_pot

# Check if this is the issue in _post_blinds():
"""
def _post_blinds(self):
    # Small blind
    sb_player = self.game_state.players[self.small_blind_position]  
    sb_amount = min(self.config.small_blind, sb_player.stack)
    sb_player.stack -= sb_amount
    sb_player.current_bet = sb_amount  # ← Blinds go to current_bet
    
    # Big blind  
    bb_player = self.game_state.players[self.big_blind_position]

# And in _end_street():
"""
def _end_street(self):
    # Commit all current bets to the pot
    self.game_state.committed_pot += sum(p.current_bet for p in self.game_state.players)
    # ↑ This should include blinds from first street
    
    # Reset per-player street state  
    for p in self.game_state.players:
        p.current_bet = 0.0
"""

# POTENTIAL FIX - Add debug logging to trace blinds:
"""
def _post_blinds(self):
    # ... existing blind posting code ...
    
    total_blinds = sb_amount + bb_amount
    print(f"🔍 DEBUG: Posted blinds totaling ${total_blinds}")

    print(f"🔍 DEBUG: Committed pot now: ${self.game_state.committed_pot}")
    
    # ... rest of method ...
"""

# ============================================================================
# ALTERNATIVE FIX: Adjust Expected Pot Calculation
# ============================================================================

# If PPSM pot calculation is actually correct, fix the expectation instead:

# CURRENT CODE (in hands_review_validation_concrete.py line ~110):
"""
expected_pot = sum(action.amount for action in all_actions 
               if hasattr(action, 'amount') and action.amount)

# ALTERNATIVE FIX:
"""
# Calculate expected pot excluding blinds (since PPSM might not include them in display)
expected_pot = sum(action.amount for action in all_actions 
                  if hasattr(action, 'amount') and action.amount and action.action != 'POST_BLIND')
# Add blinds separately if PPSM accounts for them differently
expected_pot += hand_model.metadata.small_blind + hand_model.metadata.big_blind  # Only if needed
"""

# ============================================================================
# IMPLEMENTATION PRIORITY
# ============================================================================

"""
1. HIGHEST: Fix #1 (CALL 0.0 issue) - This directly breaks validation
2. MEDIUM: Fix #2 (Enhanced CALL validation) - Defensive programming  
3. LOWEST: Fix #3 (Blind accounting) - May just be expectation mismatch

Apply Fix #1 first and retest. If HC series hands now complete successfully, 
then tackle the blind accounting issue.
