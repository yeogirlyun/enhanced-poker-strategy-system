Test Online Poker Legends PHH Hands

This file tests the Online Poker Legends category hands in PHH v1 format
against our poker state machine to ensure they can be accurately replicated.

NOTE: Only No-Limit Hold'em hands are included, as the poker state machine
only supports this variant. PLO hands have been removed.
