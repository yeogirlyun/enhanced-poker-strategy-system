# ==============================
# EXAMPLE OF HOW CLEAN THIS BECOMES
# ==============================

# OLD WAY (complex overrides):
# - Override _set_player_cards_from_display_state with 50+ lines
# - Duplicate change detection logic
# - Fight parent's assumptions
# - Complex conditional logic

# NEW WAY (simple hooks):
# - Override _should_show_card: return True (1 line)
# - Override _transform_card_data: fetch actual cards (10 lines)
# - Override update hooks for responsive behavior (1 line each)
# - Clean, focused, testable methods
