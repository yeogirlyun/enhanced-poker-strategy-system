# FPSM Hands Review Panel - Display Fixes

## 🎯 Issue Identified

The FPSM hands review panel wasn't updating the display correctly when users selected legendary hands and pressed the "Next" button. The poker widget wasn't receiving proper updates from the FPSM's display state.

## 🔧 Root Causes

1. **Missing Update Types**: The `ReusablePokerGameWidget` didn't handle `full_update`, `action_executed`, `state_change`, and `hand_complete` update types
2. **Incomplete Event Handling**: The FPSM events weren't being properly translated to widget updates
3. **Player Data Updates**: Player information (cards, stacks, bets) wasn't being updated correctly
4. **Missing Methods**: Some event handling methods were missing

## ✅ Fixes Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Update Display Method

**File**: `backend/ui/components/reusable_poker_game_widget.py`

```python
def update_display(self, update_type: str, **kwargs):
    """Update display based on state machine instructions."""
    try:
        if update_type == "full_update":
            self._handle_full_update(**kwargs)
        elif update_type == "action_executed":
            self._handle_action_executed(**kwargs)
        elif update_type == "state_change":
            self._handle_state_change(**kwargs)
        elif update_type == "hand_complete":
            self._handle_hand_complete(**kwargs)
        # ... other update types
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"❌ Error in update_display: {e}")
```

### 2. Full Update Handler

**File**: `backend/ui/components/reusable_poker_game_widget.py`

```python
def _handle_full_update(self, **kwargs):
    """Handle a full display update."""
    print("🎯 Full display update requested")
    if self.state_machine:
        # Update all player information
        for i, player in enumerate(self.state_machine.game_state.players):
            if i < len(self.player_seats) and self.player_seats[i]:
                player_seat = self.player_seats[i]
                player_pod = player_seat.get("player_pod")
                
                if player_pod:
                    # Update player data
                    player_data = {
                        "name": player.name,
                        "stack": player.stack,
                        "bet": getattr(player, 'current_bet', 0),
                        "starting_stack": 1000.0
                    }
                    player_pod.update_pod(player_data)
                    
                    # Update player cards if available
                    if hasattr(player, 'cards') and player.cards:
                        self.set_player_cards(i, player.cards)
                    
                    # Update player folded status
                    if hasattr(player, 'has_folded') and player.has_folded:
                        self._mark_player_folded(i)
        
        # Update community cards, pot, and highlight current player
        # ... additional updates
```

### 3. Action Executed Handler

**File**: `backend/ui/components/reusable_poker_game_widget.py`

```python
def _handle_action_executed(self, **kwargs):
    """Handle action executed event from FPSM."""
    player_name = kwargs.get('player_name', '')
    action = kwargs.get('action', '')
    amount = kwargs.get('amount', 0)
    
    print(f"🎯 Action executed: {player_name} {action} ${amount}")
    
    # Find player index by name and handle the action
    if self.state_machine:
        for i, player in enumerate(self.state_machine.game_state.players):
            if player.name == player_name:
                # Handle the action based on type
                if action == "fold":
                    self._handle_player_fold(player_index=i, player_name=player_name)
                elif action == "call":
                    self._handle_player_call(player_index=i, player_name=player_name, amount=amount)
                # ... other actions
                break
```

### 4. State Change Handler

**File**: `backend/ui/components/reusable_poker_game_widget.py`

```python
def _handle_state_change(self, **kwargs):
    """Handle state change event from FPSM."""
    new_state = kwargs.get('new_state', '')
    print(f"🎯 State change: {new_state}")
    
    # Update the display based on the new state
    self._handle_full_update()
```

### 5. Hand Complete Handler

**File**: `backend/ui/components/reusable_poker_game_widget.py`

```python
def _handle_hand_complete(self, **kwargs):
    """Handle hand complete event from FPSM."""
    winners = kwargs.get('winners', [])
    print(f"🎯 Hand complete: {len(winners)} winners")
    
    # Show all cards for the final hand
    self.reveal_all_cards()
    
    # Update the display
    self._handle_full_update()
```

### 6. Enhanced Event Handling

**File**: `backend/ui/components/fpsm_hands_review_panel.py`

```python
def on_event(self, event: GameEvent):
    """Handle events from the FPSM."""
    print(f"🎯 FPSM Event: {event.event_type}")
    
    # Update the UI based on the event
    if self.poker_game_widget:
        if event.event_type == "action_executed":
            self.poker_game_widget.update_display("action_executed", 
                player_name=event.player_name,
                action=event.action.value if event.action else "unknown",
                amount=event.amount
            )
        elif event.event_type == "state_change":
            self.poker_game_widget.update_display("state_change",
                new_state=event.data.get('new_state', str(self.fpsm.current_state))
            )
        elif event.event_type == "hand_complete":
            self.poker_game_widget.update_display("hand_complete",
                winners=event.data.get('winners', [])
            )
        elif event.event_type == "action_required":
            # Highlight the current action player
            if event.player_name:
                self.poker_game_widget.update_display("action_start",
                    player_name=event.player_name,
                    action="",
                    amount=0
                )
        else:
            # For any other event, do a full update
            self.poker_game_widget.update_display("full_update")
```

## 🎮 How It Works Now

### 1. Hand Selection
- User selects a legendary hand from the list
- Hand information is displayed in the info panel
- User clicks "Start Simulation"

### 2. Simulation Setup
- FPSM is created with test mode and show_all_cards enabled
- Hand data is loaded into the FPSM
- Player cards, stacks, and positions are set
- Initial display is updated with `full_update`

### 3. Action Execution
- User clicks "Next Action" button
- FPSM determines the next action to take
- Action is executed in the FPSM
- `action_executed` event is emitted
- Widget updates to show the action (fold, call, raise, etc.)

### 4. State Changes
- When betting rounds complete, state changes occur
- `state_change` events are emitted
- Widget updates to show new state (flop, turn, river, etc.)

### 5. Hand Completion
- When hand ends, `hand_complete` event is emitted
- All cards are revealed
- Winners are determined and displayed

## ✅ Test Results

### Before Fixes
- ❌ No display updates when pressing "Next" button
- ❌ Cards not showing for players
- ❌ No action feedback
- ❌ No state progression

### After Fixes
- ✅ Display updates correctly with each action
- ✅ Player cards are shown and updated
- ✅ Actions are displayed with proper feedback
