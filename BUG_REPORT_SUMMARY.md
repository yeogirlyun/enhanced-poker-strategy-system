# POKER UI MISSING FEATURES - BUG REPORT SUMMARY

## What Was Found

After analyzing the logs and source code, I discovered that the poker UI is missing several critical visual features not because the code doesn't exist, but because of architectural integration failures.

## Missing Features Identified

1. **Player Highlighting** - Active players are not visually distinguished
2. **Bet/Call Chips** - Bet amounts are not displayed in front of player seats  
3. **Stack Size Display** - Player chip stacks are not shown
4. **Animations** - Chip movements, pot updates, and winner celebrations are missing
5. **Pot Money Animation** - Pot increases are not animated
6. **Winner Announcement** - Hand winners are not celebrated

## Root Cause

The main issue is that the `ReusablePokerGameWidget` is using an outdated architecture that doesn't integrate with the modern tableview components. The tableview components (`Seats`, `BetDisplay`, `PotDisplay`, `ChipAnimations`) are fully implemented and ready to use, but they're not being utilized by the main widget.

## Evidence from Logs

The logs show that:
- Player highlighting is being applied but immediately overridden
- Bet displays are being created but not properly positioned
- Stack updates are logged but not visually displayed
- Animation systems exist but are never triggered
